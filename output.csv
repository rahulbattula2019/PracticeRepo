CsrC RNA binds multiple copies of CsrA Pfam:PF02599, a protein that post-transcriptionally regulates central carbon flux, biofilm formation and motility in E. coli. CsrC antagonises the regulatory effects of CsrA, presumably by sequestering this protein. The discovery of CsrC is intriguing, in that a similar sRNA, CsrB, performs essentially the same function. Both sRNAs possess similar imperfect repeat sequences (18 in CsrB, nine in CsrC), primarily localised in the loops of predicted hairpins, which may serve as CsrA binding elements. Transcription of csrC increases as the culture approaches the stationary phase of growth and is indirectly activated by CsrA via the response regulator UvrY [1]. This RNA was also discovered in E. coli during a large scale screen [2]. The gene called SraK, was highly abundant in stationary phase, but low levels could be detected in exponentially growing cells as well [2].",SraK,cmbuild -F CM SEED,cmcalibrate --mpi CM,cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 16.55 -Z 2958934 CM SEQDB,4,47,0,0,Gene; sRNA;,Predicted; PFOLD,51,0,,,0.7659,-8.04089,1600000,444266,397,255,1,-3.3175,0.70819,2013-10-03 23:26:30,2024-09-10 04:51:11

Antizyme genes have have two partially overlapping open reading frames, the second, which encodes the functional protein requires +1 translational frameshifting. This frameshift is stimulated by a pseudoknot present 3' of the frameshift site in the antizyme mRNA. The frameshifting efficiency is dependent on the level of polyamines in the cell, when the polyamine concentration is high frameshifting is more likely to occur which leads to an increase in the quantity of functional antizyme produced. The functional antizyme acts to reduce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity which leads to a drop in polyamines present in the cell. Therefore, this family can be thought of as a biosensor for intracellular free polyamines [1].",,cmbuild -F CM SEED,cmcalibrate --mpi CM,cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 21.00 -Z 2958934 CM SEQDB,13,1595,0,0,Cis-reg; frameshift_element;,Published; PMID:15147837,640,0,,,0.66203,-4.23694,1600000,362460,137,59,1,-3.3804,0.71923,2013-10-04 00:37:38,2024-09-09 21:15:12

[1] Other non-coding RNAs uncovered in the same analysis include: speF, ybhL, metA, and serC. [1]Several studies inSinorhizobium meliloti showed that suhB element is indeed a non-coding RNA:firstly it was detected on Northern blot and called Sm8RNA[2], secondly in an RNAseq study referred to as SmelC689.[3]The mutant phenotype's (strain lacking the small RNA) cytoplasm contains higher content of polyhydroxybutyrate (PBH)storage granules than wild type strain. The sRNA is required to limit the PBH intracellular accumulation when the nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium meliloti is under condition of surplus carbon in relation to nitrogen. It has been renamed to mmgR. Further study confirmed that mmgR fine-tunes the regulation of PBH storage.[4]Northern blot confirmed the expression of the sRNA in other rhizobia species. MmgR homologues were found in most alpha-proteobacteria. The Rho-independent terminator and a single stranded region 10-mer (UUUCCUCCCU)are completely conserved. Hence, it was proposed to define a new family of alpha-proteobacterial sRNA: alpha-r8 of which mmgR is a member.[5] RNA binding protein Hfq is binding and stabilising mmgR.[6][7] Expression of the mmgR gene was shown to be controlled by nitrogen (N).[8] Further study[9] has shown that the regulatory proteins NtrC may be required for expression of mmgR gene upon N limitation.

The Xist RNA, a large (17 kb in humans) [1] transcript, is expressed on the inactive chromosome and not on the active one. It is processed similarly to mRNAs, through splicing and polyadenylation, however, it remains untranslated. It has been suggested that this RNA gene evolved at least partly from a protein coding gene that became a pseudogene [2]. The inactive X is coated with this transcript, which is essential for the inactivation. X lacking Xist will not be inactivated, while duplication of the Xist gene on another chromosome causes inactivation of that chromosome.

They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI. This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning.

SLA structure was first proposed from enzymatic and chemical probing methods [1,2] afterwards the 3D structure of Dengue (PDB:7LYF) and Zika (PDB:5U0B) SLA viruses were reported [3]. SLA interacts with the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), where SLA functions as a promoter for viral RNA synthesis by NS5 polymerase. The SLA secondary structure includes a bottom stem-loop (previously reported as SL1 and SL2), a top stem-loop (previously reported as SL3 and TL) and a side-loop (previously proposed as side SL). The side SL variate in length between flaviviruses (Tick-borne flaviviruses present a side SL >40nt), despite the lack of sequence conservation, deletion of the side SL abolish replication in Dengue virus. It is proposed that the side SL is essential to maintain the overall fold of Flavivirus SLA [3].",,cmbuild -F CM SEED,cmcalibrate --mpi CM,cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 2958934 CM SEQDB,15,2,0,0,Cis-reg;,Published; PMID:19004935,9,0,,,0.61356,-4.8806,1600000,389936,146,70,1,-3.417,0.71893,2013-10-04 03:32:05,2024-09-09 21:15:12

Downstream to the BSL lies the hypervariable bulged-stem loop region (HVR), containing a triple helix junction. The hairpin stem from this junction participates in the pseudoknot pairing with the BSL region. The pseudoknot and the BSL partially overlap and therefore cannot be formed at the same time.

During replication, a long-range RNA-RNA interaction between 5' UTR and 3' UTR of the genome is formed to initiate synthesis of new viral replicates and viral protein translation. In direct adjacency to the 5' UTR, already part of the coding region, lies the cHP structure, which is essential for the viral replication[3][4]. The first structural element is termed 5'SLA and comprises three stems (S1, S2, S3) folded as Y-shaped-like stem structure, and a side structure domain (SSD). Its overall length is around 70 nucleotides. Viral replication is stopped by disruption of S1 and S2. Further, via RNA-protein interaction with NS5, SLA serves as a promoter for RNA synthesis during circularization of the viral genome[5][6]. Despite the diversity of SSD, its stable structure is essential for infectivity[3]. The second structural element is termed 5'SLB. At its top region of the stem loop lies the translation initiation codon. It further contains the 5'UAR (upstream AUG region), which is essential for the circularization of the genome[8]. The 5'UAR interacts with the 3'UAR, which is located at the 3' UTR of the genome to form the long-range RNA-RNA interaction[8]. At the start of the coding region lies the capsid-coding hairpin region (cHP), which is followed by the 5'CS (conserved sequence). The 5'CS forms an additional long-range RNA-RNA interaction with the 3' UTR (3'CS)[5]. The cHP further aids in the start codon recognition and thus in viral replication. Studies show that the function of cHP is sequence-independent but structure-dependent[9].",,cmbuild -F CM SEED,cmcalibrate --mpi CM,cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 2958934 CM SEQDB,8,0,0,0,Cis-reg;,Predicted; LocARNA 2.0.0RC8,8,0,,,0.56525,-7.89624,1600000,263589,264,156,1,-3.0452,0.71789,2020-09-12 11:51:34,2024-09-10 04:51:11

Usually, each virus harbors two xrRNAs, xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, in the beginning of the 3' UTR [1]. The formation of these stem-loops, especially xrRNA1, is vital to ensure resistance against XRN1 activity [2]. The Y-shaped stem-loop is also termed SL II and SL IV, respectively. In order to function as xrRNA, the sequence downstream is needed as well, since the upper loop region forms a pseudoknot (PK) with the single-stranded region directly downstream to its respective hairpin. In some species, the region downstream also forms a small hairpin. In such cases, the PK interactions takes place between the two loop regions. Conserved formation of these structures were observed in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells, suggesting this region has varying functions in different hosts[3][4]. In plant-viruses, xrRNA elements have been observed as well, showing some similarities to flaviviral xrRNAs[5][6].
